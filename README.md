Project 1 — Vegetable Image Classification

This workspace contains a Jupyter notebook scaffold for Project 1 of the supervised learning class. It follows the course rules and prepares two supervised models (CNN and Decision Tree) and two feature representations (raw images and handcrafted features).

Files created:
- `project1_vegetable_images.ipynb` — Notebook scaffold with code and instructions.
- `requirements.txt` — Minimal dependencies.
- `export_notebook.py` — Helper to convert the notebook to a `.py` script.

How to use:
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter and run cells step-by-step. Set `DATA_DIR` to the local dataset path.
2. After finishing, export to script with the helper or run `jupyter nbconvert --to script project1_vegetable_images.ipynb`.
3. Follow submission rules: place the `.py` files in a single folder named `{family_name}_{first_name}_{group}`, create a doc folder `{family_name}_{first_name}_{group}_doc` with PDF report, and zip the folder.

Notes:
- Do NOT include data files in the submission zip.
- The dataset download code uses `kagglehub` as per your snippet; replace with Kaggle CLI or manual download if needed.
